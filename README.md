> March, 2016: If you're on an old version of Jekyll Now and run into a) build warnings or b) syntax highlighting issues caused by [Jekyll 3 and GitHub Pages updates](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0), just :sparkles:[update your _config.yml](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/pull/445/files):sparkles: and you'll be set!

# Jekyll Now

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it

In a few minutes you'll be set up with a minimal, responsive blog like the one below giving you more time to spend on writing epic blog posts!

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.

Your Jekyll blog will often be viewable immediately at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> (if it's not, you can often force it to build by completing step 2)

![Step 1](/images/step1.gif "Step 1")

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable a few seconds later at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io> - if not, give it ten minutes as GitHub suggests and it'll appear soon

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

![First Post](/images/first-post.png "First Post")

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
=======
# plainwhite

Simplistic jekyll portfolio-style theme for writers.

**Demo**: [thelehhman.com](https://thelehhman.com)

![plainwhite theme preview](/screenshot.png)

## Installation on Github Pages

Add this line to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
remote_theme: thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll
```

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "plainwhite"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: plainwhite
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install plainwhite

## Usage

The "plainwhite" key in \_config.yml is used to customize the theme data.

```yaml
plainwhite:
  name: Adam Denisov
  tagline: Developer. Designer
  date_format: "%b %-d, %Y"

  social_links:
    twitter: thelehhman
    github: thelehhman
    linkedIn: in/thelehhman # format: locale/username
```

**Updating Placeholder Image**

The placeholder portfolio image can be replaced by the desired image by placing it as `assets/portfolio.png` in your jekyll website.

**Comments (Disqus)**

Comments on posts can be enabled by specifying your disqus_shortname under plainwhite in `_config.yml`. For example,

```yaml
plainwhite:
  disqus_shortname: games
```

**Google Analytics**

It can be enabled by specifying your analytics id under plainwhite in `_config.yml`

```yaml
plainwhite:
  analytics_id: "< YOUR ID >"
```

**Sitemap**

It can be toggled by the following line to under plainwhite in `_config.yml`

```yaml
plainwhite:
  sitemap: true
```

**Excerpts**

Excerpts can be enabled by adding the following line to your `_config.yml`

```yaml

      url: "/resume"
```

**Dark mode**

Dark mode can be enabled by setting the `dark_mode` flag in your `_config.yml`

Search is powered by [Simple-Jekyll-Search](https://github.com/christian-fei/Simple-Jekyll-Search) Jekyll plugin. A `search.json` containing post meta and contents will be generated in site root folder. Plugin JavaScript will then match for posts based on user input. More info and `search.json` customization documentation can be found in plugin repository.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `plainwhite.gemspec` accordingly.
